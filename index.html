I’m a tech enthusiast who loves to learn new things and use my skills to make a positive difference in the world. I have experience as a project manager, canvasser, and intern for various organizations, where I gained and applied skills in data analysis, algorithmic thinking, and Agile methodology to deliver impactful results. I've also completed some projects in programming with Java, machine learning, and drone/unmanned aerial systems prototyping, which earned me some prestigious certifications and awards. In my spare time, I like to do something peaceful like hiking or rowing."/><link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png"/><link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json"/><meta property="twitter:image" content="/social-image.png"/><meta property="og:image" content="/social-image.png"/><title>Krishna Purohit</title><script defer="defer" src="/static/js/main.d5c42e15.js"></script><link href="/static/css/main.fe927caf.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript><div id="root"></div></body></html>
